# QtControlAppleScript_test
A simple test of Qt, using Apple Script to simulate keyboard control. A part of mySmartHomeTools.

In AppleScript part, simply using the System Event's "KeyStroke" to simulate a keyboard activity.
And then, tell process Google Chrome. So that if you are already watching a Video on web site. It can control the video play/pause. 
Just like you are pressing the "Space" key to play or pause this video.

Next step will create the remote version.
Maybe this tool will provide a webAPI, and sinply http request will control the play / pause instead using button.
